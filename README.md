# go-pe-proxy

This is an attempt for a BungeeCord-like proxy for MCPE. This supports 0.13.x and is very broken.

## Thanks to

* [MiNET](https://github.com/NiclasOlofsson/MiNET), a MCPE server implementation that is somewhat well-documented. Still has many gaps.
* Tbe Go team, for making an awesome programming language.
* My friends at the former The Chunk and my friends at CubeCraftGames.
